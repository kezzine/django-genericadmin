First of all, this was made to work with *newforms-admin*.  I haven't tested it against Django's trunk version of the admin site, but it supposedly works (thanks Joe).

Finally, jQuery is required (but included).

= Installation =

Installation is pretty simple.

First, place the _genericadmin_ app somewhere in your python path and add it into your settings.py

In your main urls.py, right *before*:
{{{
('^admin/(.*)', admin.site.root)
}}}

add:
{{{
(r'^admin/obj_lookup/$', 'genericadmin.views.generic_lookup'),
}}}

Copy the _admin_ folder in _templates_ into your _templates directory_.

Finally, copy the files in the _js_ folder into your _media root_ and modify the _ ADMIN_MEDIA_URL_ variable at the top of the _genericadmin.js_ file to match your media url.
