First of all, this was made to work with *newforms-admin*.  I haven't tested it against Django's trunk version of the admin site.  If anyone tests this, please let me know if it works (if it doesn't, the fix will almost certainly be trivial).

Also, if you're using newforms-admin, there is tiny bug in Django which needs to be fixed. The issues is highlighted here [http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6307 #6307].  Untill this gets patched here's how you fix it:

Open _django/contrib/admin/media/js/admin/RelatedObjectLookups.js_, scroll down and change these lines:

{{{
....
newId = html_unescape(newId.toString());
newRepr = html_unescape(newRepr.toString());
....
}}}

Finally, jQuery is required (but included).

= Installation =

Installation is pretty simple.

First, place the _genericadmin_ app somewhere in your python path and add it into your settings.py

In your main urls.py, right *before*:
{{{
('^admin/(.*)', admin.site.root)
}}}

add:
{{{
(r'^admin/obj_lookup/$', 'genericadmin.views.generic_lookup'),
}}}

Copy the _admin_ folder in _templates_ into your _templates directory_.

Finally, copy the files in the _js_ folder into your _media root_.
